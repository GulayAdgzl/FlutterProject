## Features

- **User Search**: Users are fetched from the JSONPlaceholder API via HTTP request.
- **Filtered Display**: Users are filtered based on the characters entered in the "Search for Users" field, specifically by their username.
- **No User Found**: If no users match the search criteria, the message "User Not Found!" is displayed.
- **Clear Search**: Clearing all characters from the "Search for Users" field will display all users again.
- **Clear Button**: A button is provided to easily clear all characters entered in the search field, which will then display all users again.
- **User Images**: User profile images are fetched based on the "id" field from Picsum Photos via HTTP requests.
- **User Details Popup**: Clicking on a user in the list opens a popup displaying detailed user information.

## üì¶ Dependencies

The application uses the following Flutter packages for various functionalities:

- **`provider`**: The `provider` package is employed for state management. It facilitates the management and sharing of user data and loading states across different components of the app, including the search feature.

- **`http`**: The `http` package is used to make HTTP requests to the JSONPlaceholder API and Picsum Photos. It enables the app to fetch user data and user profile images in real-time.
